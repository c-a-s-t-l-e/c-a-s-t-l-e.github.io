## Realizations and An Update

### The Gist 

Well, so far this year has been an interesting one to put it lightly. Looking back over my previous post at the start of the year, it might be time to provide some realizations and an update.

#### Realizations

1. **Design Thinking... Who Knew?**
2. **What Would C.S. Pierce's Texts Look Like?**
3. **It's the Consistancy That Counts**

#### The Update

Now, with that being said, here's the update on my goals to get through those two books mentioned in the previous post: I haven't gotten through ISLP, but I have gone through quite a for chapters of Practical Deep Learning for Coders. Those chapters have been espeically useful in constructing the neural networks we are assigned to build in my machine learning class. 

That's pretty much it though.
