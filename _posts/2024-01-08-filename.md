## Basic Definitions

## The Gist 
Here are some basic defintions of common terms from chapter 2 of ISLP when it comes to linear regression:

Parametric Functions - functions that involve explicit parameters to estimate such as $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + ε$$ with y as the target variable, $$\beta_0$$ as the expected value of $$Y$$ when $$X=0$$, $$\beta_1$$ as the per unit increase of $$Y$$ for each unit $$X$$, and $$ε$$ as the term used to represent all the stuff the model can't incorporate.
