## Basic Definitions

## The Gist 
Here are some basic defintions of common terms from chapter 2 of ISLP when it comes to linear regression:

Parametric Functions - functions that involve explicit parameters to estimate such as 

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + Îµ$$ 

Basically the y is our predicted output, the first beta is for the expected value when input value that we plug in is zero, the second beta is the increase of y for each unit input for x. More parameters like another beta can represent different influences on the predicted output.
