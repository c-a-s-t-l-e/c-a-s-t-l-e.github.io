# An Overview of Tabnet - Tabular Data Deep Learning

Hey guys! I've been exploring the tabnet model for a few days since stumbling upon it in a Github repo. For the sake of the this post, I would just like put down my understanding of the model to help you and I better understand it.

First and foremost, I would like to credit Francesco Pochetti for the images from [his blog post](https://francescopochetti.com/tabular-deep-leaning-tabnet-deep-dive/) on Tabnet. I would also like to put in the direction of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442) and [Dreamquark's Github repo](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) that has the model implemented in Pytorch. 

With that being said, we could probably start with an initial overview of the model with the image below:
