# Thoughts on Growing the Garden

### A Problem

I'm not sure if everybody's had a problem like this.

With that said, think about a time when you've wondered down a rabbit whole of links while learning about a topic. 

Now think about reviewing where you've gone down and then having sudden inspiration to make a new branch based on a new thought.

Do this a few more times and you've got ideas and connections going everywhere. 

How do you then organize it all?

### A Mind Opening Solution

Recently, I've come upon an open source project called [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). 

It's basically a really handy static site generator for Obsidian vaults. 

(If you don't know what Obsidian is, definitely feel free to check out the free, privacy conscious software [here](https://obsidian.md).)

The premise is that the website Quartz generates is like a graph in the mathematical sense of the word.

Each markdown document is a node and each link between the markdown documents are edges. 

### Why I Think This Approach Matters 

I thin this approach matters because once you've got a graph to look at you can see all the patterns you're mind as made over time. 

You can shore up parts that you're lacking and have an infinite supply of new inspiration each time you look at the whole.

This could prove to be a way to enjoy your work and learning more.
