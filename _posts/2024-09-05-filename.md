## Another Update ðŸ˜†

### So Basically...

Since last time I've contributed to this blog, there's been quite a bit of stuff that has gone down that had made it difficult to write in here / I kind of forgot about this until now.

With that being said though:

1. I've decided I'll graduate at the end of this year.
2. I've decided that I'll try and stretch my creative wings more by doubling down on what I like by trying to build some decently sized but doable projects as well as continue studying. This includes continuing to build out deep learning models and honing my skills with traditional machine learning as well as building out tools for processing texts and documents and being a "non-traditional artist".

With all that being said, I've decided to build out some of my ideas I have been collecting for about a year or so.

The first I would like to introduce is called scrib. I now hope to make it a PDF viewer that let's the user navigate docs easier and make them more interactive. I'd like to thank the course in design thinking that I took last semester for helping identify a problem.

Overall though, let's see where this path takes us...
