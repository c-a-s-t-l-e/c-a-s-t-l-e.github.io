## Another Update ðŸ˜†

### So Basically...

Since last tiem I've contributed to this blog, there's been quite a bit of stuff that has gone down that had made it difficult to write in here / I kind of forgot about this until now.

With that being said though:

1. I've decided I'll graduate at the end of this year.
2. I've decided that I'll try and stretch my creative wings more by doubling down on what I like by trying to build some decently sized but doable projects as well as continue studying. This includes continuing to build out deep learning models and honing my skills with traditional machine learning as well as building out tools for processing texts and documents and being a "non-traditional artist".
