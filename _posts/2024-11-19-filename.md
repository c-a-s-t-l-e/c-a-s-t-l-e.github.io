# Senior Projects

Hey everybody! 

So I was just wanting to give an update on my senior project experience; originally it started out helping a data science do time series prediciton on appointments for a mental health start-up named Spring Health, but as time has gone on, \
I've gradually lost interest with the problem and originally started working on another side project on the side which has now become my full-time project.

The gist is that I've created and am currently refining a program that allows one to upload their general entries as txt documents, have a model do fine-grained emotion analysis of the text, and then show a dashboard that displays historical data \
as to when various emotions have been most prominent over time.

Progress has been great, and I'll eventually have it all up here on Github.

In general, I'd like to think of it as an exploration into what language modelling can do to help us become better at figuring out who we are. 

I'll also write-up some documentation for all of this really soon as well.
