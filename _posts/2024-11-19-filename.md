# Senior Project

Hey everybody! 

So I was just wanting to give an update on my senior project experience; what orignally started out as a side project has now become my full-time project.

The gist is that I've created (and am currently refining) a program that allows one to upload their general entries as txt documents, have a model do fine-grained emotion analysis of the text, and then show a dashboard that displays historical data as to when various emotions have been most prominent over time.

Progress has been great, and I'll eventually have it all up here on Github.

In general, I'd like to think of it as an exploration into what language modeling can do to help us become better at figuring out who we are. 

I'll also probably write-up some documentation for all of this really soon as well.
