I'm going to keep this kind of short, but I just wanted to state that in the personal_study repo that is available on my Github I have a collection of my notes from the stuff I'm studying in my free-time.

The main motivation of writing this here is to then hold myself accountable since I know a silent crowd (real or imaginary) knows that I'm trying to do this too.
