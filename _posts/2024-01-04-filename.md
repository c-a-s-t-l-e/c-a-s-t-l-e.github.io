## Trying Something New for the New Year

### The Gist

I'm going to keep this kind of short, but I just wanted to state that in the personal_study repo that is available on my Github I have a collection of my notes from the stuff I'm studying in my free-time.

The main motivation of writing this here is to then hold myself accountable since I know a silent crowd (real or imaginary) knows that I'm trying to do this too.

Two resources I hope to get through by the end of the year (depending on classes, life, etc.):

+ [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Appplications in Python (ISLP)](https://www.statlearning.com/)
+ [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)

I'm working on the first right now.
