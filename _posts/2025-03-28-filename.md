## Why I Want to Improve My Writing

There are a few reasons why 
I want to improve my writing. 

The first is that when you can communicate clearly 
people can better understand you and your goals.

The second is that when you can write well
you can inspire others. 

The first thing I would like to do
is to use sense-line formatting. 

This approach will allow me 
to identify ways to improve
the structure of the text. 

At the very least,
it will also make
this blog easier to read
on mobile.
